# OPERATION

An interactive piece that tells a story about Central American Minors panel to panel as the audience removes each burden from the body onto a separate platform. 

## Summary

For my final piece, I aimed to tell the story about the unknown and unseen Central American Minors who are in solitary confinement today in part of America's billion dollar prison industry. I wanted an interactive and striking way to bring awareness to the issue because the minor's story deserve more than a passive storytelling. I created a piece where the audience must remove each burden from the body onto a separate platform to continue listening to the story. So not only are they interacting with this new information, but also is given a sense of responsiblity of the story they're choosing to hear. 

I wanted the body to feel small, cold, and in a mode of shock while the audience felt bigger and more powerful than the body in front of them. So if I do get the recreate this, I would like to play around with different types of materials and scale. 

The coding was challenging for me as always but I was able to get a lot of help from J.D. and Lei. Thank you :). The wiring part was surpirsingly easy after I figured out how to wire the first one. The only problem was that I broke a couple of my magnetic switches along the way because it was made out of glass. 

## Component Parts

I used: breadboard, featherboard, magnetic switch, magnets(too strong so I "weakened" them by wrapping it around with paper and tape), male and female wires

Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use, and a block diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.

## Challenges

The wiring part itself was difficult because I was dealing with fragile glass magnetic swithces that kept on breaking. Also, since the scale of my piece wasn't too big, it became a bit frustrating and confusing when I had to wire all seven of the switches close to eachother.
